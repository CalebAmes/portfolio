### Thanks for checking out my portfolio repo!

If you are interested in running this locally for whatever reason here is how you can do it

- `cd` into the portfolio repo
- `ls` to double check that you are in the root (you should see a package.json file)
- run `npm install` in your terminal to install dependancies that are needed like <b>ThreeJS<b/> and <b>Socket.IO<b/>
- run `npm run dev` to run locally on port :3000
- navigate to `localhost:3000` in your browser
  
Additionally if you want to build the application into static files and compile TS into JS
- run `npm run build` to build 
- run `npm start` to run the static file server (you will not have hot reloading)
